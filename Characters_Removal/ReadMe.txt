#Characters Removal
Given two strings "str" and "rm", the code removes every occurrence of characters found in 
"rm" from "str".

Example:
str: C++ is fast, scalable and efficient.
rm: +eea
Output: C is fst, sclbl nd fficint.

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please, set the desired strings in "main.cpp" before compiling the code.

Example:
std::string str = "C++ is fast, scalable and efficient.";
std::string rm = "+eea";

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#To compile
make

#To run
./cr
